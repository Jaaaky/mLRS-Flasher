# mLRS Flasher Desktop App #

Link to the [mLRS project](https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS).


## Installation ##

### Windows ###

mLRSFlasher is based on Python, and thus needs a full Python3 installation on your system. Not very Win-like, we know, and we applogize for this. 

- Install Python3 on your system, if you don't yet have it. Ensure that Python is in the PATH (the usual Pythion installation tutorials say how to check that)
- Download the github repo and ensure you have unpacked it if you downloaded it as zip.
- Run the mLRS_Flasher.py script.
- It may happen that you get a bunch or errors and need to install additional packages. Follow the error messages.

### MacOS ###

#### Prerequisites ####

Open the terminal and run the following commands to install Brew, Python and the virtualenv module - this only needs to be done once.

``` 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install python
pip install virtualenv 
```

#### Run the Flasher ####

````
./run_mLRS_Flasher_mac.py
````

### Linux ###

TBD


## Disclaimer ##

You of course use the app fully at your own risk.
