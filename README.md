# mLRS Flasher Desktop App #

Link to the [mLRS project](https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS).


## Installation ##

### Windows ###

You have two options:
- Download the file mLRS_Flasher.zip from the "app_windows" folder and store it to somewhere on your drive. Unpack it, and run mLRS_Flasher.exe. You can create a desktop shortcut to this file for easier access also. 
- Download the github repo and run the mLRS_Flasher.py script. This requires that you have python3 and few required packages installed on your system.

The advantage of the second method is that mLRS_Flasher operates a bit more userfriendly.

### MacOS ###

#### Prerequisites ####

Open the terminal and run the following commands to install Brew, Python and the virtualenv module - this only needs to be done once.

``` 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install python
pip install virtualenv 
```

#### Run the Flasher ####

````
./run_mLRS_Flasher_mac.py
````

### Linux ###

TBD


## Disclaimer ##

You of course use the app fully at your own risk.
